            As much as I want to sing in the rain and roll in the snow. I have a weak immune system so I'm sure that I would become ill. The thought is rather dreamy though.

            I'm Victoria. I enjoy quiet evenings scrolling the internet as much as wild nights that seep into daylight. I like taking photos, watching cartoons, and playing video games in my free time. I would like to claim that I am pretty good at gaming but some of my teammates would greatly disagree. I am pretty anxious in general, it takes me a while to adjust to my surroundings. Also I greatly surprised at how much coffee normal people consume.
